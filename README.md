#Project title : Vehicles Listings Dashboard
#the app allows you check the conditions of various vehicles and their prices. we can filter by various factors such as model, model year, cyclinder type, car type, fuel type, etc. 
#this app produces scatter plots, and histograms, with checkbox filters
I've used various libraries in this app such as: pandas, scipy, plotly, altair, and streamlit.  which require installation.
